<!-- <h3>This project is a HTML and CSS loading animation.</h3>

It was made by making a circle and then 3 different arches in different positions. Then I centered the loading text in the middle and made sure to rotate the 'Loading..' text in the opposite direction so that the text in the span wouldn't be upside down.
