<h4>This project is a vertical sliding page which could be used for a product, a portfolio and more. There are two panels, left and right, with text on the left and a picture on the right and two buttons in the middle where the panels meet. If you push one button, the each panel moves up and down simultaneously in manner pleasing to the eye.</h4>
